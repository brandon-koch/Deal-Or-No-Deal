# Deal Or No Deal
Deal or No Deal game played through the python console. Includes 26 case amounts, interactive menu, and keeps track of your highest score.

In order to set up the pickle files to correctly track your highest score, uncomment lines 16-18 and run the code. This will set up a file to store your highest score.
Once you run the code with these lines uncommented, go back and comment out those lines. This will prevent the same default score from appearing every time.
